    <h2>LONELINESS</h2>

    <pre>   Now it is Loneliness who comes at night
    Instead of Sleep, to sit beside my bed.
    Like a tired child I lie and wait her tread,
    I watch her softly blowing out the light.
    Motionless sitting, neither left nor right
    She turns, and weary, weary droops her head.
    She, too, is old; she, too, has fought the fight.
    So, with the laurel she is garlanded.

    Through the sad dark the slowly ebbing tide
    Breaks on a barren shore, unsatisfied.
    A strange wind flows ... then silence. I am fain
    To turn to Loneliness, to take her hand,
    Cling to her, waiting, till the barren land
    Fills with the dreadful monotone of rain.</pre>

    <h2>THE GULF</h2>

    <pre>   A gulf of silence separates us from each other.
    I stand at one side of the gulf, you at the other.
    I cannot see you or hear you, yet know that you are there.
    Often I call you by your childish name
    And pretend that the echo to my crying is your voice.
    How can we bridge the gulf? Never by speech or touch.
    Once I thought we might fill it quite up with tears.
    Now I want to shatter it with our laughter.</pre>

    <h2>ACROSS THE RED SKY</h2>

    <pre>   Across the red sky two birds flying,
    Flying with drooping wings.
    Silent and solitary their ominous flight.
    All day the triumphant sun with yellow banners
    Warred and warred with the earth, and when she yielded
    Stabbed her heart, gathered her blood in a chalice,
    Spilling it over the evening sky.
    When the dark plumaged birds go flying, flying,
    Quiet lies the earth wrapt in her mournful shadow,
    Her sightless eyes turned to the red sky
    And the restlessly seeking birds.</pre>

    <h2>VERY EARLY SPRING</h2>

    <pre>   The fields are snowbound no longer;
    There are little blue lakes and flags of tenderest green.
    The snow has been caught up into the sky--
    So many white clouds--and the blue of the sky is cold.
    Now the sun walks in the forest,
    He touches the boughs and stems with his golden fingers;
    They shiver, and wake from slumber.
    Over the barren branches he shakes his yellow curls.
    ... Yet is the forest full of the sound of tears....
    A wind dances over the fields.
    Shrill and clear the sound of her waking laughter,
    Yet the little blue lakes tremble
    And the flags of tenderest green bend and quiver.</pre>

  <div class="poem" id="poem-5">
    <h2>THE AWAKENING RIVER</h2>

    <pre>   The gulls are mad-in-love with the river,
    And the river unveils her face and smiles.
    In her sleep-brooding eyes they mirror their shining wings.
    She lies on silver pillows: the sun leans over her.
    He warms and warms her, he kisses and kisses her.
    There are sparks in her hair and she stirs in laughter.
    Be careful, my beautiful waking one! you will catch on fire.
    Wheeling and flying with the foam of the sea on their breasts,
    The ineffable mists of the sea clinging to their wild wings,
    Crying the rapture of the boundless ocean,
    The gulls are mad-in-love with the river.
    Wake! we are the dream thoughts flying from your heart.
    Wake! we are the songs of desire flowing from your bosom.
    O, I think the sun will lend her his great wings
    And the river will fly away to the sea with the mad-in-love birds.</pre>

    <h2>THE EARTH-CHILD IN THE GRASS</h2>

    <pre>   In the very early morning
    Long before Dawn time
    I lay down in the paddock
    And listened to the cold song of the grass.
    Between my fingers the green blades,
    And the green blades pressed against my body.
    “Who is she leaning so heavily upon me?”
    Sang the grass.
    “Why does she weep on my bosom,
    Mingling her tears with the tears of my mystic lover?
    Foolish little earth child!
    It is not yet time.
    One day I shall open my bosom
    And you shall slip in--but not weeping.
    Then in the early morning
    Long before Dawn time
    Your lover will lie in the paddock.
    Between his fingers the green blades
    And the green blades pressed against his body ...
    My song shall not sound cold to him
    In my deep wave he will find the wave of your hair
    In my strong sweet perfume, the perfume of your kisses.
    Long and long he will lie there ...
    Laughing--not weeping.”</pre>

    <h2>THE OPAL DREAM CAVE</h2>

    <pre>   In an opal dream cave I found a fairy:
    Her wings were frailer than flower petals,
    Frailer far than snowflakes.
    She was not frightened, but poised on my finger,
    Then delicately walked into my hand.
    I shut the two palms of my hands together
    And held her prisoner.
    I carried her out of the opal cave,
    Then opened my hands.
    First she became thistledown,
    Then a mote in a sunbeam,
    Then--nothing at all.
    Empty now is my opal dream cave.</pre>

    <h2>SEA</h2>

    <pre>The Sea called--I lay on the rocks and said:
    “I am come.”
    She mocked and showed her teeth,
    Stretching out her long green arms.
    “Go away!” she thundered.
    “Then tell me what I am to do,” I begged.
    “If I leave you, you will not be silent,
    But cry my name in the cities
    And wistfully entreat me in the plains and forests;
    All else I forsake to come to you--what must I do?”
    “Never have I uttered your name,” snarled the Sea.
    “There is no more of me in your body
    Than the little salt tears you are frightened of shedding.
    What can you know of my love on your brown rock pillow....
    Come closer.”</pre>

    <h2>JANGLING MEMORY</h2>

    <pre>   Heavens above! here’s an old tie of yours--
    Sea-green dragons stamped on a golden ground.
    Ha! Ha! Ha! What children we were in those days.

    Do you love me enough to wear it now?
    Have you the courage of your pristine glories?
    Ha! Ha! Ha! You laugh and shrug your shoulders.

    Those were the days when a new tie spelt a fortune:
    We wore it in turn--I flaunted it as a waist-belt.
    Ha! Ha! Ha! What easily satisfied babies.

    “I think I’ll turn it into a piano duster.”
    “Give it to me, I’ll polish my slippers on it!”
    Ha! Ha! Ha! The rag’s not worth the dustbin.

    “Throw the shabby old thing right out of the window;
    Fling it into the faces of other children!”
    Ha! Ha! Ha! We laughed and laughed till the tears came!</pre>

  <div class="poem" id="poem-10">
    <h2>THE SECRET</h2>

    <pre>   In the profoundest ocean
    There is a rainbow shell,
    It is always there, shining most stilly
    Under the greatest storm waves
    And under the happy little waves
    That the old Greek called ‘ripples of laughter.’
    And you listen, the rainbow shell
    Sings--in the profoundest ocean.
    It is always there, singing most silently!</pre>

  <div class="poem" id="poem-11">
    <h2>SEA SONG</h2>

    <pre>   I will think no more of the sea!
    Of the big green waves
    And the hollowed shore,
    Of the brown rock caves
    No more, no more
    Of the swell and the weed
    And the bubbling foam.

    Memory dwells in my far away home,
    She has nothing to do with me.

    She is old and bent
    With a pack
    On her back.
    Her tears all spent,
    Her voice, just a crack.
    With an old thorn stick
    She hobbles along,
    And a crazy song
    Now slow, now quick
    Wheeks in her throat.

    And every day
    While there’s light on the shore
    She searches for something,
    Her withered claw
    Tumbles the seaweed;
    She pokes in each shell
    Groping and mumbling
    Until the night
    Deepens and darkens,
    And covers her quite,
    And bids her be silent,
    And bids her be still.

    The ghostly feet
    Of the whispery waves
    Tiptoe beside her.
    They follow, follow
    To the rocky caves
    In the white beach hollow ...
    She hugs her hands,
    She sobs, she shrills,
    And the echoes shriek
    In the rocky hills.
    She moans: “It is lost!
    Let it be! Let it be!
    I am old. I’m too cold.
    I am frightened ... the sea
    Is too loud ... it is lost,
    It is gone...” Memory
    Wails in my far away home.</pre>

    <h2>STARS</h2>

    <pre>   Most merciful God
    Look kindly upon
    An impudent child
    Who wants sitting on.
    This evening late
    I went to the door
    And then to the gate
    There were more stars--more
    Than I could have expected,
    Even I!
    I was simply amazed
    Almighty, August!
    I was utterly dazed,
    Omnipotent! Just
    In a word I was floored,
    Good God of Hosts--Lord!
    That at this time of day
    They should still blaze away,
    That thou hadst not rejected
    Or at least circumspected
    Their white silver beauty--
    Was it spite ... Was it duty..?</pre>
