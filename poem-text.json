  "text": "Last night for the first time since you were dead<br \/>\nI walked with you, my brother, in a dream.<br \/>\nWe were at home again beside the stream<br \/>\nFringed with tall berry bushes, white and red.<br \/>\n“Don’t touch them: they are poisonous,” I said.<br \/>\nBut your hand hovered, and I saw a beam<br \/>\nOf strange, bright laughter flying round your head<br \/>\nAnd as you stooped I saw the berries gleam.<br \/>\n“Don’t you remember? We called them Dead Man’s Bread!”<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke and heard the wind moan and the roar<br \/>\nOf the dark water tumbling on the shore.<br \/>\nWhere--where is the path of my dream for my eager feet?<br \/>\nBy the remembered stream my brother stands<br \/>\nWaiting for me with berries in his hands ...<br \/>\n“These are my body. Sister, take and eat.”<br \/>\n",
