  "text": "Last night for the first time since you were dead<br \/>
I walked with you, my brother, in a dream.<br \/>
We were at home again beside the stream<br \/>
Fringed with tall berry bushes, white and red.<br \/>
“Don’t touch them: they are poisonous,” I said.<br \/>
But your hand hovered, and I saw a beam<br \/>
Of strange, bright laughter flying round your head<br \/>
And as you stooped I saw the berries gleam.<br \/>
“Don’t you remember? We called them Dead Man’s Bread!”<br \/>
  I woke and heard the wind moan and the roar<br \/>
Of the dark water tumbling on the shore.<br \/>
Where--where is the path of my dream for my eager feet?<br \/>
By the remembered stream my brother stands<br \/>
Waiting for me with berries in his hands ...<br \/>
“These are my body. Sister, take and eat.”<br \/>
