      <h1>The Garden-Party Demo Page</h1>

<p class="introductory-section">And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more
perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm,
the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light
gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up
since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the
dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As
for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses
are the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only
flowers that everybody is certain of knowing. Hundreds, yes, literally
hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down
as though they had been visited by archangels.</p>
